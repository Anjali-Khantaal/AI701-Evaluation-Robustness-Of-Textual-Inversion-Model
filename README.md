# AI701: Robustness Evaluation Of Textual Inversion Model and Multi-Concept Inference

This repository contains <fill>:

1. **SD Textual Inversion Training** - A notebook for training textual inversion models using state-of-the-art tools.
2. **Multi-Concept Inference** - A notebook focused on inference tasks involving multiple concepts in AI models.
3. <Ishita to fill>

All notebooks leverage cutting-edge frameworks such as PyTorch, HuggingFace, and more, providing robust tools for researchers and developers.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. SD Textual Inversion Training
This notebook facilitates:
- Training textual inversion models.
- Utilising tools like `diffusers` and `transformers` for model development.
- Accelerated computation with `torch` and `accelerate`.

### 2. Multi-Concept Inference
This notebook enables:
- Inference tasks involving multi-concept datasets.
- Utilising pre-trained models with `diffusers` and `transformers`.
- Efficient computation with advanced libraries like `torch`.

### 3. <Ishita to fill>

## Installation

### Using pip
Install the required libraries directly:

```bash
pip install IPython pillow accelerate argparse diffusers huggingface_hub numpy torch torchvision tqdm transformers
```

## Using a requirements.txt file
Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

IPython
pillow
accelerate
argparse
diffusers
huggingface_hub
numpy
torch
torchvision
tqdm
transformers

Then run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Notebooks

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```
2. Ensure you have all dependencies installed (as mentioned above).
3. Launch the notebooks:
  3.1. For SD Textual Inversion Training:
   ```
   jupyter notebook sd_textual_inversion_training_1_latest.ipynb
   ```
  3.2. For Multi-Concept Inference:
  ```
  jupyter notebook multi_concept_inference.ipynb
  ```

This project is inspired by the Textual-inversion model present on HuggingFace: <enter link>
